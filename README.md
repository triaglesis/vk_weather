# vk_weather
== Weather parse

- Used old and deprecated Yandex mail server;
- Used xml data to find weather forecasts;
- Compose PICTURE with forecast;
- Compose TEST with forecast;
- POST to facebook and vkontakte;

All code, texts, drafts included.

Fyrther developing stopped after Yandex close its weather xml page.
Can be simply changed for xml from weathet.com if you know how it works.

P.S. Have no time to make it better look and store code and data separatelly.
Some of my work and how-to can be found in my blog: http://trianglesis.org.ua
